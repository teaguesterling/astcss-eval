RELATIONS AND COMBINED FILTERS (written directly after the node, no space; chain several to require all)
  [receiver="x"]          a call made on x                          .call[receiver="pantry"]   .call#restock[receiver="pantry"]
  [signature="T"]         a function whose return type is T         .fn[signature="Quaternion"]
  [annotation*="x"]       a definition whose decorator mentions x   .fn[annotation*="memoize"]
  :calls(name)            a function whose own body calls name (not a nested function's)   .fn:calls(emit_token)
  :called-by(name)        a call made directly inside the function name   .call:called-by(paint_frame)
  :is-called              a function called somewhere in its file;  :not(:is-called) never called
  :is-referenced          a definition used somewhere in its file;  :not(:is-referenced) never used
  :exported               a public definition at module level
  .fn#tally_votes::callers    the functions that call tally_votes
  .fn#paint_frame::callees    the calls paint_frame makes
  :scope(.class#Name)     a node whose nearest enclosing class is Name   .fn:scope(.class#Tokenizer)
  :decorated  :async  :typed      has a decorator / is async / declares a return type
  Chained on the last step:  .fn:has(.call#dial_port):not(:has(.try))
                             .class#Tokenizer .fn:calls(advance_cursor):not(:has(.throw))
                             .fn:has(.call[receiver="pantry"]):not(:has(.try))
